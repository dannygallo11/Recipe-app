The idea for this app is to allow you to look up any recipes by either a specific ingredient, diet type, or recipe name. 

Once you identify the recipe you would like, you will be able to add the contents of the recipe to your grocery list. Based on your serving size, the specific amount of each ingredient will be added. 

This app uses HTML, CSS, Javascript & React.js for front end. 

It also uses Node.js & Express.js to communicate with Spoontacular API, which is the API for the recipe information.
